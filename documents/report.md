# Sander's process of implementing components and page of Screenshot 1.

**Important info about the assignment:**
Since my group member left the study program in the middle of this assignment, after the groups had been established, I notified the teaching assistants and course coordinator about this. I worked on this project alone, and in accordance to the task only created one of the pages. I have demonstrated the ability to merge two different branches by creating two for myself.

## Task 1: Observing and identifying main components of the design system

I looked at at Fabric's design manual and pointed out where I found components and other bigger sections, and named them, in the drawn screenshot 1 file.

## Task 2: Observed how elements in Finn.no reacted to different states and implemented them

I observed the elements on Finn.no to see how they reacted to being hovered, clicked, focused etc. and implemented them into my css. I also made my own branch.

## Task 3: Implementing the Screenshot 1 page

I chose to implement the screenshot 1 page. I then made the structure in HTML and additionally added BEM classes to the components of the page. After the HTML structure was in place, I began styling the page components. The style for the components I found in the official Fabric design manual was placed in *common.scss*, this includes the search and card components. The rest of the components specific to screenshot 1 was placed in *style.scss*.

## Task 4: Implementing the demo.html page

In the demo page I placed the components I had identified from the Fabric design manual, and presented the different statuses with their modifiers.

## Task 5: Merging into main branch

I merged the sandebac brach into the main branch for delivery.
